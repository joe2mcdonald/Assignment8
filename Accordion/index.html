		<h1>Learn more about cameras!</h1>
		<h2><a href="#">What kind of camera should I get?</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>As Annie Leibovitz once said " The best camera is the one you have with you. " Their is a lot of truth to that. But let me break it down a bit for you. So you can do your due dilligence. 
			There are many different things to consider when choosing a camera. First of all you need to examine what you want to use it for. And how often you plan to use it. 
			</p>
		</div>
		<h2><a href="#">What is a digital single lens reflex - DSLR??</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>Several features:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It has a mirror.</li>
				<li>It lets you look directly through the lens at the subject. </li>
				<li>You can change the lens.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<h2><a href="#">What kind of lens do I need for a DSLR?</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>It depends on what type of pictures you take. Generally this is differentiated by landscapes, portraits, sports, closeups.
			</p>
		</div>
		
				<h2><a href="#">Should I get a flash?</a></h2>
		<div>
			<p>Again it depends on what type of pictures you take. However, considering the increased sensitivy to light of the newer cameras and that the lens lets in much more light then cameras / lens have in the past; I would have to say no. At least not initially.
